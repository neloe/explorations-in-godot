## Video 15: One Way Collision
* while he just adds static objects, can make a tilemap that's oneway (enable one way collision in the tileset
* I'm getting some slightly odd behavior where I'm alling through some one way collision

## Video 16: Parallax background
* Interesting bit with parallax: When you put sprites in, make sure to turn off centered
* When doing color modulation, choose EITHER the parallax object or the sprite, and be consistent
* Modulation does a blending mode

## Video 17

* `get_tree().change_scene("res://path_to_scene.tscn")`: another way to reset the level
